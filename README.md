# Spring Framework: Web Implementation

This is a repository for a Java project that used Spring Framework. In this project I implemented Web Framework using Spring. This was
intended for Framework Programming course.

This is a basic implementation from sending form, managing form data on the model, and fetching it back to the web client.

Here are several useful links to use Spring Framework

The Eclipse-based IDE for Spring Framework (no need to install it!)
  - https://spring.io/tools

The mandatory library to use Java:
  - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

And the library (the actual framework):
  - https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/
