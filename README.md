# Spring Framework: Web Implementation

This is a repository for a Java project that used Spring Framework. In this project I implemented Web Framework using Spring. This was
intended for Framework Programming course.

This is a basic implementation from sending form, managing form data on the model, and fetching it back to the web client.

First time starting it up using Tomcat, you will see a page like this.
![alt text](https://github.com/rareguy/carweb1-spring/blob/master/WebContent/resources/car-theme/img/mainpage.png?raw=true "mainpage")

Input a merk and type to the text box on the top form, and then press the Add button, it will be shown on the right side.

Input a merk and type to the text box on the below form, and then press the Add button, and it will redirect you to another page to show you the form result.
